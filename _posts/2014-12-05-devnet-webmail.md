I have not been doing much lately so I decided to spice up the webmail used by my clients and myself. The base is Roundecube <sup>[1]</sup> and the skin was originally by Mr. Dieck but heavily modified by me. This is what it currently looks like:

<a href="https://k0nsl.org/blog/k1/uploads/2014/12/devnet_webmail02_k0nsl.png"><img src="https://k0nsl.org/blog/k1/uploads/2014/12/devnet_webmail02_k0nsl-1216x603.png" alt="devnet_webmail02_k0nsl" width="620" height="307" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-6531" /></a>

It's an ongoing project, but I think that it looks far better than the default "Larry"-skin used in Roundcube, in my view.

The "Larry"-skin looks like this:
<a href="https://k0nsl.org/blog/k1/uploads/2014/12/mx-backup01_k0nsl.png"><img src="https://k0nsl.org/blog/k1/uploads/2014/12/mx-backup01_k0nsl-1216x604.png" alt="mx-backup01_k0nsl" width="620" height="307" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-6533" /></a>

Right. That's it! <img class='wpml_ico' alt='' src='https://k0nsl.org/blog/k1/plugins/wp-monalisa/icons/icon_e_wink.gif' />
