This is my Swiftech Storm water block that Swiftech sent to me in early 2005, if I'm not mistaken. It was a sample. First revision. Today I decided to clean it up, but it hardly needed any cleaning at all. The only thing it could possibly need is polishing, but I have no such items at hand. So I merely gave it a brush-up.

Enjoy the photographs. A few of the photographs actually turned out half-decent.
