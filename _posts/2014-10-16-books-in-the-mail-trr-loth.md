[caption title="Two essential books" url="https://k0nsl.org/blog/k1/uploads/2014/10/trr-loh06_k0nsl.jpg"]

I received a couple of very interesting books today in the mail; the mail man came honking his horn and I ran outside in anticipation for what I knew was already coming...

<strong>And there they were!</strong> A copy of the groundbreaking and legendary "Rudolf Report" together with the best starter book on the whole topic: <strong>"Lectures on the Holocaust—Controversial Issues Cross Examined"</strong>.

As I opened the package I was happy to see that both of the books survived the ordeal of the postal service, having received a big gushing hole in the package, which was big enough to reveal the contents therein. The books themselves weren't damaged.

What of the contents? Here they are, signed and dedicated by <a href="http://germarrudolf.com/" target="_blank">Germar</a>. I withheld my name for my own safety:

I have included the basic information for each book in the sections below. I would recommend buying the hardcover version of each book and to display them proudly in your bookshelf -- one day these books will be very sought after items, the day when <strong>"The Big H"</strong> has totally collapsed. It already has been scientifically and academically refuted. The narrative has been destroyed. However, the general populace, overall, hasn't received notice about it because they are inundated with daily lies via the media and all the institutions who promote the discredited 'holocaust' story.

I think both of these books are a "must have" for anybody interested in the topic, or for those who are simply curious to know more about it. Be open minded and read the material.

[divider]The Rudolf Report[/divider]

<blockquote>In 1988, Fred Leuchter, American expert for execution technologies, investigated the alleged gas chambers of Auschwitz and Majdanek and concluded that they could not have functioned as claimed. Ever since, Leuchter’s claims have been attacked. In 1993, Rudolf, a researcher from the prestigious Max Planck Institute, published a thorough forensic study about the “gas chambers” of Auschwitz. His report irons out the deficiencies and discrepancies of “The Leuchter Report.” The Rudolf Report was the first English edition of this sensational scientific work. This new edition analyzes all existing evidence on the Auschwitz gas chambers and offers even more evidence. The conclusions are startling. Appendix describes Rudolf’s unique persecution—this brilliant scientist was so feared by the mainstream holocaust establishment that they banned him from writing about or researching the subject as terms of his release from prison!

Here’s what several scholars had to say about this book:

<blockquote><strong>"I am extraordinarily impressed. To my knowledge, you are the first expert in Germany who has addressed this particular topic in a scholarly impeccable and well-founded way. It is not for me to attribute an ice-breaker function to your expert report. It is easy to see which political-historical effects will originate from it, though its entire dimension cannot yet be estimated."</strong> —Prof. Dr. Hellmut Diwald, Historian, January 22, 1992</blockquote>

<blockquote><strong>"I read it with great interest. [...] My impression is, however, that this expert report is an important contribution to a very important question which, since the ‘Leuchter Report,’ needs to be answered urgently. [...] One can only very much hope that the well-known tactics of hushing up is not applied to your expert report, but that critical responses and comments will be made."</strong> —Prof. Dr. Ernst Nolte, Historian, January 28, 1992</blockquote>

<blockquote><strong>"For me, the significance of receiving your report rests on the fact that it substantially contributes to our stock of knowledge. With many of my collegues active in the field of contemporary history, I am overjoyed and thankful for you having initiated this research activity. Of course, I am even more delighted regarding the results of your accurate scientific investigation."</strong> —Prof. Dr. Werner Georg Haverbeck, Historian, January 31, 1992</blockquote>

<blockquote><strong>"I calmly read your report! It gives me hope to realize that a representative of the younger generation courageously sets out, with scientific thoroughness, noticeable great expertise, and corresponding investigative curiosity, to get to the bottom of a controversial question that is of worldwide significance! The result is clear and unequivocal! True facts cannot be suppressed forever! I wish that your work will make the breakthrough!"</strong> —Prof. Emil Schlee, Historian, April 1, 1992</blockquote>

<blockquote><strong>"[...] I sincerely hope that all statements about this topic would obviously be based on long and intensive work such as yours. Most of it is certainly unverifiable for the layman, but the photographs are already quite informative. [...]"</strong> —Prof. Dr. Ernst Nolte, Historian, January 6, 1993</blockquote>

<blockquote><strong>"Rudolf is a young scientist who tried to prove in an excellently layed-out work with tables, graphics, and so on, that the gas chambers were technically impossible. [...] These scientific analyses are perfect."</strong> —Hans Westra, Anne-Frank-Foundation, BRT 1 TV (Belgium), Panorama, April 27, 1995</blockquote>

<blockquote><strong>"All in all, he relies on literature which was written long before this report was completed, and the report must be described as scientifically acceptable."</strong> —Prof. Dr. Henri Ramuz, Chemist, interrogated as expert witness about the Rudolf Report by the Swiss Court at Châtel-St.-Denis, May 18, 1997</blockquote>

[divider]Lectures on the Holocaust[/divider]

<blockquote>In 1976, Holocaust revisionism produced its last "standard work," if there ever was such a thing: A.R. Butz' Hoax of the Twentieth Century. "How can a quarter century old text not be obsolete today?" Butz asks in the preface of the 2003 edition of his own book, pointing out "the age of this text, and the great advances that have subsequently occurred in Holocaust revisionism." Hence, there is a great need for a new, integrated work summarizing Holocaust revisionism after 30 years of very intensive and thorough research.

<strong>And here it is, the new standard work of Holocaust revisionism!</strong> It was written by German scholar, writer, and publisher Germar Rudolf, based on the research of the most prominent revisionists, most of which Rudolf had the pleasure to publish in a multitude of German and English language journal articles and books over the past 15 years.

The book was written to fit the need of both those who have no in-depth knowledge of the Holocaust or of revisionism, as well as for well-versed readers familiar with revisionism. Anyone who wants to bring himself up to date on revisionist scholarship, but does not want to read all the special studies that were published during the past ten years, needs this book!

Since 1992, Rudolf has been giving lectures to various mainstream audiences all over the world. His topic is very controversial: the Holocaust in the light of new forensic and historical findings. Rudolf’s sometimes astounding facts and arguments fall on fertile soil among his listeners, as they are presented in a very sensitive and scholarly way. This book is the literary version of Rudolf’s lectures, enriched with the most recent findings of historiography.

The book’s style is unique: It is a dialogue between the lecturer and the reactions of the audience. Rudolf introduces the most important arguments and counter arguments of Holocaust revisionism. The audience reacts with supportive, skeptical, and also hostile questions. The Lectures read like an exciting real-life exchange between persons of various points of view. The usual moral, political, and pseudo-scientific arguments against revisionism are addressed and refuted. This book resembles an entertaining collection of answers to frequently asked questions on the Holocaust. With generous references to a vast bibliography, this easy-to-understand book is the best introduction into this taboo topic for both readers unfamiliar with the topic and for those wanting to know more.
