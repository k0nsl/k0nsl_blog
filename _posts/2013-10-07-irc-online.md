Okay, so I finally got around to fixing the IRC server again, and this time I decided to keep it very simple. The IRCd is 'Feisty Weasel' coupled with Atheme IRC Services <sup><a href="#n1">[1]</a></sup>. Took a bit of modding for the services, but they're working fine <img class='wpml_ico' alt='' src='https://k0nsl.org/blog/k1/plugins/wp-monalisa/icons/icon_thumbup.gif' />
The web page <sup><a href="#n2">[2]</a></sup> for the IRC is very simple. I cannot be bothered to spend any considerable amount of time on that bit, not right now. I suggest that people use a real IRC client rather than a webIRC client, not that they're bad - except for IRCCloud which Digerati tried to lure me into, but I didn't fall for that. A honeypot full of feds, no thank you <img class='wpml_ico' alt='' src='https://k0nsl.org/blog/k1/plugins/wp-monalisa/icons/evilgrin39.gif' />

As for the web page, it currently looks like this:
<a href="https://k0nsl.org/blog/k1/uploads/2013/10/k0nsl-irc-07.png"><img src="https://k0nsl.org/blog/k1/uploads/2013/10/k0nsl-irc-07-300x192.png" alt="k0nsl-irc-07" width="300" height="192" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-5701" /></a>

I'll probably improve upon it whenever I feel like it. As it stands right now, either use it, or connect directly to irc.k0nsl.org on port 6667 with a traditional IRC client of your choice.
