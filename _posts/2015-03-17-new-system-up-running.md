[divider]Video Description[/divider]

Combobulated is the keyword <small><i>(is that even a word?)</i></small>

At any rate, this is a system I pulled together from bits and pieces and a CPU which was sent to me from Hong Kong. The CPU is a <a href="https://k0nsl.org/blog/the-e8400-finally-arrived/">E8400</a>, socket 775.

Motherboard? Asus Maximus Extreme, see: <a href="http://k0nsl.org/bag/hardware/Asus_Maximus_Extreme/" target="_blank">http://k0nsl.org/bag/hardware/Asus_Maximus_Extreme/</a>

Cooling? It's passively cooled by a Thermochill PA120.3.

Temperatures? It idles at about 45 Â°C so heat is not much of an issue. If it becomes one I'll just slap on a fan or three ;-)

OS? Jewbuntu ;-/

I'm still not entirely sure what purpose the system will serve nor am I fully decided on what type of OS to run. Only time will tell.

Overclocking? At the moment it's running at 4960MhZ (9 ratio @ <s>440 FSB</s>): so out of the box I've gained almost two gigahertz from it. It's currently undergoing stress testing at this speed. The only worries I have is with the northbridge heat. It's a bit toasty <img class='wpml_ico' alt='' src='https://k0nsl.org/blog/k1/plugins/wp-monalisa/icons/evilgrin39.gif' />

Sorry about the crappy video: I'm not very good at filming, or even putting together a clip. I rush it and it comes out as a confabulated mess. Plus, Sony is not really helping out much in lieu of the horrendous focus-problem they have with their cameras. Blergh.
