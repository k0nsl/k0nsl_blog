A few basic/generic tests on BuyVM's 'lv-node16' after their upgrade to E5-2630L CPUs. I don't have any comparisons because I lost the previous benchmark results, somehow. Very sloppy of me <img class='wpml_ico' alt='' src='https://k0nsl.org/blog/k1/plugins/wp-monalisa/icons/icon_crazy.gif' />

For me, the only interesting results are the UnixBench <sup>[1]</sup> numbers.

<ul class="list-2">
<li>(1) <a href="https://code.google.com/p/byte-unixbench/" target="_blank">The purpose of UnixBench is to provide a basic indicator of the performance of a Unix-like system; hence, multiple tests are used to test various aspects of the system's performance. These test results are then compared to the scores from a baseline system to produce an index value, which is generally easier to handle than the raw scores. The entire set of index values is then combined to make an overall index for the system.</a></li>
