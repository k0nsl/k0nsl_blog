Well, "pdf.k0nsl.org" and "media.k0nsl.org" are both down at this moment, but I still do have all of the files saved on my NAS here at home. However, I'm currently on a rather restrictive data plan and it would cost me a bit to have all of this uploaded again. Solution? You can contact me at <a href="mailto:i.am@k0nsl.org">"i.am@k0nsl.org"</a> and donate a few bucks. I will give you instructions via e-mail contact. I already have the servers standing by, its just a matter of having the files uploaded again. The old URLs/addresses will be exactly the same as they were before.

I am sorry for this inconvenience; I did not anticipate it myself.

So far one person have made a contribution in order to get the PDF library restored. However, this is not going to cover my bills. If more people need this extensive online library up and running, please contact me at i.am@k0nsl.org and I will send you instructions on how to make a contribution.
