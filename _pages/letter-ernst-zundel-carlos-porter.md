I received this letter in 2004 and got permission to publish it on my now defunct 'holocaust detoxification' site. I have moved over most of the material on that site to this blog, it just isn't very easy to find it.<br /><br />
At any rate, here is an excerpt from letters written by Ernst Zündel to Carlos W. Porter, dated 29 November 2004. As far as I'm aware these letters and the <a href="https://k0nsl.org/blog/detox/copy-of-reply-to-ernst-zundel-re-howard-fertig-edition-of-hitler-speeches/" target="_blank">subsequent reply by Carlos W</a>. Porter is only available on k0nsl.org and nowhere else -- unless somebody copied them.

<h3>[START OF LETTER TO CARLOS W. PORTER]</h3>

.. regarding NS finances, I recommend that you order the November-December issue of The Barnes Review, PO Box 15877, Washington DC 20003. He has an article in there by Stephen M. Goodson, entitled “Bonaparte and Hitler Versus the International Bankers”. This issue will go a very long way in helping you with your research in this area and several others, because it deals with related topics in other important international areas. I had for years had evidence that Napoleon was wise to the role of banking and the international intrigues of banking circles. Dr. Faurisson’s sister drew my attention to a speech Napoleon gave in 1805-6 in Paris, connecting Jews to these issues, which of course puts a very different light on his subsequent troubles and his Hitler-like encirclement and poisoning by arsenic. 

The author claims, and I have seen it elsewhere over the decades, that strands of Napoleon’s hair had been forensically tested (hair analysis). I did not know that it was “the” Chemistry and Toxicology Unit of the F.B.I. which did the actual test on the hair to Betsey Balcombe in 1818. The F.B.I. found that the levels of arsenic found were “consistent with arsenic poisoning”. 

This is particularly interesting, because Hitler too was poisoned by one of his mysterious physicians, the infamous Dr. Morrell. David Irving wrote a book, one of his more “filler and fluff” books on what kind of medicines, vitamins, minerals and anti-gas pills Hitler was taking by mouth and by direct intravenous injection (or was it intramuscular? I do not have my files here! I am going strictly by memory (faulty since the bomb and fire). But I did have the benefit of years of contact with Dr. Hans Dietrich Roehrs, who wrote a very important and hotly persecuted book in the 1960s entitled ”Adolf Hitler: Die Zerstoerung einer Persoenligkeit” [Adolf Hitler: Destruction of a Personality], published or at least distributed by the “Scharnhorst Buchgemeinschaft”, in which he details how Morrell was manoeuvred into Hitler’s path – then inner circle – and how he compromised Hitler’s emotional and physical state of mind by the administration of potions which were, of all things… imported from Portugal, via Hungary, via Prague to Berlin! 

Dr. Roehrs suspected that Hitler was being poisoned, and since he was the third highest doctor in the Third Reich, and, as a bureaucrat in Dr. Conti’s Health Ministry, he had access to the prescriptions and content of what Morrell gave Hitler! He began to investigate what Hitler was on! Dr. Roehrs wanted to see what the effects were, that these compounds produced, had some ordered and injected them into himself in the same doses Hitler was given by Morrell. 

He described to me what happened to him as the drugs took effect. He gave them to himself in the same time sequence Hitler got his -- a certain amount of time before an important speech in Warsaw before 500 doctors and health care professionals in the East in the 1940s! 

He said that he experienced a dissociation between his conscious mind and his personality – he gave a rousing speech, frequently interrupted by rounds of applause – which he experienced himself as if he was totally shielded, as if by a glass curtain, from his enthusiastic audience – to which he felt no connection, but an eerie separateness! An aloofness – other-worldly! 

After the speech he was introduced to selected members of the audience and political functionaries – again, they were not aware of his dissociated state! 

As it began to wear off he had the same feeling that comes associated with a hangover! 

He had the contents of the mixture analysed! 

Some compounds could not be properly identified by the German labs of the time! Alarm bells rang in his head! He took it up with Dr. Conti – Reichs Aertze Fuehrer [Reichs’ Physicians’ Leader] and with officials in the Health Ministry. Consternation reigned! The SS or Gestapo got involved – and suddenly Dr. Roehrs was in trouble – like any whistle-blower today – so he volunteered for the Waffen-SS at age 43, even though he had 9 children at the time. He felt that this move saved him from the wrath of the people who were, even then, working within the highest echelons of the Nazi-Regime, who had manoeuvred Dr. Morrell into his important position. Morrell stayed Hitler’s “injection giver” til the end. Hitler himself had a hand in the composition of these “Mega-Vitamin-Mineral+Dextrose” injections. His near-Parkinson’s symptoms, signs of arteriosclerosis (extensive hardening of the arteries by calcification) which was responsible for his arms trembling and facial twitching, was due to the rapid absorption – too rapid – of the Dextrose (Traubenzucker) into Hitler’s bloodstream! 

In summary: Dr. Roehrs felt that the OSS – forerunner of the CIA – was, by this circuitous route, via Portugal, then re-packaging at each step in the journey, was feeding Hitler these chemical drugs – mind-altering compounds, he called them early barbiturates or LSD-like compounds. Significantly, Dr. Morrell was the only high-ranking Nazi and Hitler-intimate who was not put in the “Prominenten-Lager”, [Big-Shot Camp], a camp for high-ranking Nazis; also he was the only Nazi whose vast bank accounts were not seized, confiscated or blocked after 8 May 1945. Instead, he lived in one of the finest hotels and health spas in Garmisch-Partenkirchen or Berchtesgaden. 

It was there that Hugh Trevor-Roper interviewed him in the health spa, in luxury! As you know, he [Roper] was a British intelligence officer! Roper used some of this information in a book (it could be “The Brutal Friendship”). Anyway, Morrell bragged, amongst other things, that he had decided the outcome of the greatest tank battle in the history of the world, by knocking Hitler virtually out for 16 crucial hours, with an injection, while the Kursk Salient unfolded. Hitler was virtually unable to function, he was so groggy, incapable of making decisions. Dr. Roehrs quoted Roper, calling Dr. Morrell a quack – and the British Board of Jewish Deputies (M.P.s), egged on Dr. Morrell’s widow to sue Dr. Roehrs over this quote of Roper’s, stating that her husband had been a medical quack! 

Roehrs found out that they hired high-powered British and German law firms – she only lent her name! 

The case came before the German courts and the nationalist media from the 1960s until the early 1970s, when I often spent many days with Dr. Roehrs at his Maasden hunting and country house, where he lived in splendid isolation and retirement. He had been the town’s Mayor for 5 consecutive terms. One time I spent 10 days with him, staying as a guest at his home. I taped many hours of conversations with him, copies of which I handed over to his son after his death. 

I am not sure that my tapes survived the heat and the steam and soot of the 1995 massive arson attack. I have not listened to any of these tapes because I took such a beating, partly psychically, and partly psychologically, from the fire and subsequent bomb that I was sick and tired of this issue. Also, every time I raised the topic with leading revisionists or main stream historians they jumped on me – some do it to this day – because a doped-up Adolf Hitler would not be good for the German and N.S. image of the man! 

I could sympathize and empathize with them – who wants to kick a man when he’s down? I did not! But we need to record history honestly, so we can learn from those mistakes! 

I mean, Carlos! Picture this scene! 

The most powerful man in Europe had his prescription filled in the nearest Aptothek [drugstore] to the Reichskanzerlei! 

[<strong>COMMENT:</strong> <em>PERHAPS THIS REFERS TO HIITLER’S OTHER PRESCRIPTIONS, SINCE THIS WOULD OTHERWISE CONTRADICT THE CLAIM THAT THE MEDICATIONS WERE REPACKAGED AND SENT FROM PORTUGAL. HOW COULD THEY BE FILLED IF SOME OF THE COMPOUNDS COULD NOT BE IDENTIFIED? UNLIKE OUR “BELOVED” AMERICAN PRESIDENTS, HITLER IS KNOWN TO HAVE TAKEN ALMOST NO SECURITY MEASURES.</em> – C.P.] 

His medicines were not tested! The Gestapo did not screen them – what utter, criminal negligence, but all too typical for the utterly naïve and “weltfremde Einstellung” [other-worldly attitude] of these otherwise very worldly German official circles. You can bet your life that that Stalin, Roosevelt and Churchill were not that careless with their food and medicine! 

[<strong>COMMENT:</strong> <em>Stalin was also poisoned by his doctors. THE WOLF OF THE KREMLIN: THE FIRST BIOGRAPHY OF L.M. KAGANOVICH, THE SOVIET UNION’S ARCHITECT OF FEAR, by Stuart Kahan, Kaganovich’s American nephew, William Morrow & Co., 1987, describes in detail how it was done.</em> –C.P.] 

By the way – Dr. Roehrs was condemned in the end to a large fine of about DM 15,000, just for quoting Roper correctly, but insensitively and negatively impacting the posthumous reputation of Hitler’s doctor! Just imagine that!! Wow! 

What other Nazi big-wig can you quote to me who enjoyed such extraordinary protection of his reputation 25-30 years after the war? The doctor who kept the “monster” healthy! 

And finally – the real shocker! [<strong>COMMENT:</strong> <em>ACTUALLY, QUITE MUNDANE AND PAR FOR THE COURSE.</em> –C.P.] 

Dr. Roehrs wanted me to admit to the existence of the gas chambers, because he had heard from a man called Dr. Finkenscher [?], who lived near Thies Christopherson, that he, in turn, had heard of, not seen, or investigated, the existence of the gas chambers! 

I naturally made it my business to track down this old codger, and on one of my visits, went to the old farmhouse where he rented a room from some farmer! His table was a black coffin which he had built for himself out of an old dead tree stump, in which he was going to be buried. He had been some military official in an administrative capacity with absolutely no first-hand information of any sort, or any proof of his claim! 

I confronted Dr. Roehrs with that. He had obviously, like so many Germans of the wartime generation, bought into the gas chamber story – as David Irving so movingly explained in Toronto during his testimony (1988) and his many speeches … “I saw all those films… those documentaries, I saw those supposed gas chambers… tools for mass extermination… and I believed!” Now, upon closer examination and after rethinking the basis and images of my belief… I now no longer believe… now I know that I was deceived, etc.” It was moving testimony, great rhetoric, and the Jews were at first taken by utter surprise, and is their habit, went to work on Irving, making his life hell, ruining his career, and suddenly he found convincing evidence that there may in fact have been experimental gassings in “gas wagons” and all the nonsense he spouted at his trial before his mousy Judge Grey in Londons’ Old Bailey Court. 

When history came calling, he was, like so many, not up to it, and, in my opinion, displayed a pitiful figure of waffling and compromising. [DELETION] Sad – I liked the man – but I knew from the beginning that he had a dual if not multiple personality. 

[DELETION] 

Carlos – my advice to you would be this: 

Contact Carto, or his office, and buy some back issues of the Barnes Review. He has good, very good, well-researched articles on Hitler and many aspects of the Third Reich. 

[DELETION] 

You would save yourself years of painstaking research by using the heavily footnoted articles in the Barnes Review! 

I know some of the sources cited, and they are cited correctly. Why should you, I, reinvent the wheel? We can build on one another’s research and get on with the job. 

Especially, the books by Leon Degrelle are tremendous sources of informational inspiration… 

[DELETION] 

But back to Hitler! I believe, based on what Otto Wagener says, and quotes Hitler himself as saying, in his [Wagener’s] book, “Adolf Hitler: Confessions of a Confidant”, that Hitler was a mediumistic personality, like Rudolf Steiner, or, to a lesser, cruder extent, Thomas Edison, Nicolas Tesla or Edgar Cayce! 

Hitler describes the process of when he knew he was in touch with a force beyond this dimension – when cosmic truths came through him like a chameleon – which always turned out to be correct, right, and only had errors in it when he – Hitler – tried to “edit” or “correct” these concepts, messages! Wagener’s book is a revelation, simply amazing. 

You can be sure that the old Masonic, Satanist Rabbis, steeped in their ancient Kabbala, knew this about A.H., and they needed to break the reception mechanism, Hitler’s brain and intuition, by altering his brain-chemistry! Via the drugs administered by Morrell! Check Hitler’s decisions carefully (in depth), look at the repercussions, setbacks, miscalculations, outright errors and you will see that he began to lose his sure, sleepwalker-like touch after the arrival of Dr. Morrell. Correlate the decisions to the medication – it alerted Dr. Roehrs, who was a National Socialist from the earliest time, in the early 1920s! He was sufficiently concerned with Hitler’s behaviour and state of mind, observed as ad admirer and follower, that HE investigated it! 

[<strong>COMMENT:</strong> <em>THIS BEGS THE QUESTION OF HOW HITLER COULD ALLOW ANYONE LIKE MORRELL ANYWHERE NEAR HIM IN THE FIRST PLACE.</em> – C.P.] 

In my opinion, that is revisionism of a far more sophisticated kind than… mere gas chamber revisionism! 

That issue has been dealt with, and solved! No archaeologist goes over and over the ruins of Schliemann’s Troy – it would be ridiculous, what would be the sense? 

That’s what Revisionism means to me! 

Review other events, all events, like the attacks on New York (the reason I believe I was hijacked out of the US was because I published unpalatable truths on that). 

Or food, nutrition, soil, mineral content or medical revisionism – all things more relevant than how many Jews fit into a non-existent gas chamber! 

With my kind of revisionism, we assume the same kind of roles the Neo-Con think tanks assume and play in the work of our enemies! 

Hitler had 34 Nazi Think-Tanks, Research Institutes, dealing with Race, the Jewish Question, Cancer, T.B., Smoking, Nutrition, Alcoholism, Heredity (early version genetics). 

Not one single Nazi Think Tank’s research findings or their exhaustive published papers and reports, much less their research libraries, comprising many tens of thousands of books, papers, articles, studies, experiments have ever surfaced! Not ONE in 59 years! Why not? 

Somebody seized this material! You can bet that the victors exploited this condensed Brain-Power of the German nation for their post-war benefit. 

I have tracked down smidgens, especially in the fields of aviation, rocketry, navy, and ordinance, like extended-range ammunitions, Cruise missiles submarines, etc.! What about the results of the work in other fields, like selective breeding – regression breeding, to the Stone Age pony, to Mammoths, etc.! Where is all that brain work? That’s what we should be combing the archives for. To heck with the gas chambers! I am sick of it. That’s it! You could be of much help! 

Ernst as always! 

<h3>EXCERPT FROM ANOTHER LETTER ALSO DATED 29 NOVEMBER 2004</h3>

Carlos – 

Wow! That was one hell of a letter, re rare books, etc. [DELETION] 

Carlos -- if I could make a suggestion to you – forget the Holocaust – we have solved that Jewish lie and exposed the racket. 

You could do the world a far greater SERVICE by being the interpreter of Hitler. [DELETION] 

I could help you in finding and in narrowing down topics of interest to make the man more human. 

I have understood his role, his genius, his mission – which in my opinion, was the bearer of cosmic truths – he was far, far more than a mere leader of a political party, or even ideology – he brought us a new, integrated version of Aryan Being. Some thought he was the bringer of a new religion of racial purity – but he was the bearer and channeller of something well beyond religion, or even ideology, even beyond “Weltansanschauung” because he was beyond and above “this world”. 

Otto Wagener, in his book, “Adolf Hitler: Confessions of a Confidant”, Gustav Kubicech [spelling?] in “Adolf Hitler: My Boyhood Friend” and Howard Fertig’s “Collected Speeches of Adolf Hitler 191-1938 or 9” [republished by Gordon Press] are musts! Also, “The Nazi War on Cancer”, his ideas on health! Very informative. His Table Talks are a must. “The Brutal Friendship” [Roper], trash! Shirer, garbage! A.J.P. Taylor, not much better! 

[<strong>COMMENT:</strong> <em>Here I must agree. I am glad to find somebody who dislikes A.J.P. Taylor as much as I do.</em> - C.P.] 

Fest, Speer, careful, careful! Even the trilogy by Erich Kern [DELETION] 

Civilizations, like food in the super market, have their “Expiry Dates”. We are past ours – 1945 was it! Now it’s collecting the remnant, starting anew – that’s our job! 

Ernst as always! 

[<strong>FINAL COMMENT BY CARLOS W. PORTER:</strong> <em>I am inclined to agree with most of what Ernst says, except that I believe that any discussion of Hitler will always have to be prefaced by a discussion of the gas chamber lie, the lie of exclusive German war guilt, and the truth about Allied atrocities and war crimes, as this is the only way to establish Hitler’s credibility. Otherwise everything will simply be dismissed with the assertion that “Hitler was a liar”! [Show me an American president since Coolidge or Hoover who hasn’t been]. So we are stuck with the gas chamber lie just as much as the Jews are – probably until the end of time (or the end of the Jews, which ever comes first).</em>] 

On National Socialist science, I personally recommend one short, but difficult and very dry book, SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY AND REPARATIONS: EXPLOITATION AND PLUNDER IN POSTWAR GERMANY by John Gimbel, Stanford University Press, 1990. 

The author describes the manner in which German scientific and technical research, including private commercial trade secrets protected by international patent law and worth billions, was simply stolen and sold or given to private American companies for risible sums of money. A single paragraph in a single German document was said to have been worth 100,000 dollars to one American company. The scope of the plunder is such that one is almost left with the impression that the Americans actually provoked the war just to indulge in international thievery on a gigantic scale. This probably explains where most of the “Nazi Think-Tank” material actually disappeared to. – C.P.] 

The following are a few paragraphs from the book, pp. 22-23: 

“Howland H. Sargeant, the chairman of the wartime THC, the agency that collected both written and oral reports from investigators upon their return from Europe after the war, testified before a committee of Congress early in February 1946 that our top people in Germany had discovered and brought back technical know-how on a cold steel extrusion process used by the Germans to produce shell fuses at the rate of about twenty or thirty per minute, while Americans produced similar fuses at a rate of about one every three minutes. Such ‘processes carry over directly’ to peacetime production, Sergeant observed. Noting that the United States had some 600 sheet-stamping shops and more than 2,500 manufacturing shops that stamped materials out of sheet metal, he concluded that all of these could use this process to produce more economically and efficiently, and to manufacture ‘far more intricate parts than ever before’. 

“Variations of the rubber story and the cold-steel extrusion theme could be repeated for synthetic fuel, jet aircraft, rockets, infrared, aerial photography, optical glass, electron microscopes, power circuit-breakers, die-casting equipment, wind tunnels, acetylene chemistry, textiles and textile machinery, X-ray tubes, forest products, ceramics, colors and dyes, tape recorders, heavy presses, diesel motors, high-tension cables, radio condensers, insecticides, color film processing, a unique chocolate-wrapping machine, a continuous butter-making machine, a precision grinding machine, a “hot welding” process for making radiator cores, and other technologies. Wind tunnels found in Germany were reported to be ‘far superior’ to anything in use in the United States, and a working model on a twin-engine diesel motor was judged to be ‘far superior to anything that had been produced or planned in the States’. ‘An ingenious German machine’ for producing radio condensers was thought to be advanced enough to ‘revolutionize the manufacture of condensers for radio, radar, and other electric and electronic equipment’. Textile industry technicians, one of whom reportedly said ‘we have been asleep here’, found German ‘textiles and yarns with no commercial counterpart in this country’ and ‘equipment for spinning worsted yarns ‘superior to ours’. Finally, Army Signal Corps experts and ‘many manufacturers and designers of electrical equipment in this country’ judged German die-casting machines – which the Germans had used to produce bomb parts, fuses, radio and field telephone sets, field glasses, camera parts, and ‘complete radio chassis of excellent design’ to be ‘a real advance in the die casting art’. 

SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY AND REPARATIONS: EXPLOITATION AND PLUNDER IN POSTWAR GERMANY by John Gimbel, Stanford University Press, 1990, pp. 22-23.] 

I ALSO RECOMMEND “ARE THE RUSSIANS TEN FEET TALL?” [OST – WEST = NULL] by Werner Keller, translated by Constantine Fitzgibbon and Sybil Welsh, published by Thames and Hudson, London, 1961.
