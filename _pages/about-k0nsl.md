<p style="text-align: left;">[author] [author_image timthumb='on']https://k0nsl.org/static/k0nsl_57x57.jpg[/author_image][author_info]Below is a brief -- somewhat basic -- run-down on k0nsl. This page is in no-way complete, but merely a modest presentation that intends to shed some further light onto the person behind the pseudonym "k0nsl" - and this page will eventually be filled with useful information. In the meanwhile, if you believe something is missing from this presentation we suggest that you peruse <a title="Google k0nsl" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=k0nsl">Google</a> to find out the missing links - Google can, at times, be very helpful in finding out more information on all sorts of topics and issues <img class="wpml_ico" src="https://k0nsl.org/blog/k1/plugins/wp-monalisa/icons/icon_think.gif" alt="" />[/author_info] [/author]</p>
The person behind this site and the one who develops all sorts of miscellaneous — or varied — Web Pages is an ebullient young web-entrepreneur known only by the pseudonym “k0nsl” and has been involved with the development of web-coding (and more!) for over 15 years and runs his own company, known as the devNET software group.

k0nsl collects domains and his main interests are networking, system administration and modern history. When it comes to operating systems k0nsl favours Linux variants over any other currently available solutions; he is a Linux enthusiastic and have been using Linux for some 15 years  - opportunity allowed for access to computers and the Internet from an very early age, allowing k0nsl to self-study information technology in all its variations and forms.

In the late 1990s (yeah the "nineties") k0nsl founded several underground groups, most notably one that was called "Fallen Angels" -- a group which consisted of mostly German members. In 1999 k0nsl was asked to be part of another group called "War Industries" (or simply 'Warind'/'Wi2k'). Somewhere between 1999 and early 2000 k0nsl started to hang out with a group called "Sm0ked crew" (known to them as "system33" or "system33r" and also "teksys"), but unfortunately this chapter is something that must remain a secret forever. At any rate, he was a personal friend of Melkor -- the founder and owner of "Blackcode Ravers", he knew and spoke to the people behind "Technical Warfare" and was also at good terms with the guys in <a href="http://www.progenic.com/" target="_blank">"Progenic Security"</a> (their site is still up!). k0nsl also had a hand in making "ICQ WAR 2000", a site that existed for only a short period of time but was incredibly popular (this was late 1999: so its non-existent today, but the domain was "icqwar.com" and fragments of it is available via archive.org).
In April 2000 k0nsl was sacked from "War Industries" and in revenge <a href="http://attrition.org/mirror//attrition/2000/04/04/www.warindustries.com/" target="_blank">he defaced their server</a> [<a href="https://k0nsl.org/blog/k1/uploads/2012/04/attrition-org-system33-warindustries-dot-com01_k0nsl.png">pic?</a>], using one of his aliases, that time his old "System33" alias --- ironically, he defaced "War Industries" on the very same day they let him go. Later on, the group "System33 Security" followed which attracted a number of members who mainly focused on the defacement of web pages and the release of malware -- mostly benevolent ones. For example the <a href="http://www.virus-database.com/description/5060-win95.sab.html" target="_blank">Win95.Sab</a> (or Win9x.H0l0caust 2000); a virus which did very little harm.

k0nsl is also a <a href="http://codoh.com/library/series/1020/" target="_blank">Holocaust revisionist</a> in the sense that he does not believe in the eternal and for many holy "Six Million"-figure (who does?) or in fantastical <a href="https://k0nsl.org/blog/detox/eyewitnesses-to-gas-chambers-the-peculiar-things-they-say/"><u>"gas chamber" stories</u></a> and other worthless atrocity propaganda about the 'ever so evil Germans' -- using his knowledge of technology to his own advantage he also <a href="https://k0nsl.org/blog/other/the-desperate-face-of-a-holocaust-believer/"><u>virtually owned a defender of the "hoax"</u></a>, tried to debate with him using logic and reason -- but failed! The "holocaust" believers (or at least the bulk of them) do not react to logic and reason, so k0nsl managed to capture the reactions of the believer via webcam, without his knowledge -- the poor "holocaust" believer would put a stick in his mouth at the end of the debate and proceeded to run out of his room in absolute despair. No harm done, only humour! <img class='wpml_ico' alt='' src='https://k0nsl.org/blog/k1/plugins/wp-monalisa/icons/icon_lol.gif' />

k0nsl has also been a strong supporter of <a href="http://www.cpiu.us/" target="_blank">CPIU</a> since its inception in 2002.</p>

[divider]A side note[/divider]
Here's a little curious something I found while researching my "history" on the Internet, an old site of mine called "Exploit-X" which I founded in the year 2000 (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000711033018/http://www.exploit-x.co.uk/" target="_blank">see old mirror</a>) bears the same exact index (more or less!) as my current site does (<a href="https://k0nsl.org" target="_blank">k0nsl.org</a>). If you browse old "H/P/C/A"-sites you'll see that they often link to "System33 Security" and "Exploit-X". I get a little sentimental when I think about those times <img class="wpml_ico" src="https://k0nsl.org/blog/k1/plugins/wp-monalisa/icons/icon_e_wink.gif" alt="" />
