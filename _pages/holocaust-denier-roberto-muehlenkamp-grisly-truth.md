We male and female anti-fascists of the Anti-Fascist League against Holocaust Denial know that one should never ever enter into a discussion with the racist, anti-Semitic and neo-fascist neo-Nazis, who cynically deny with pseudoscientific‎ arguments the commonly known historical fact of the world-historically unique murder of six million Jews by the inhuman Nazi regime. For these deniers produce their pseudoscientific‎ arguments in such a diabolically able manner that no normal person can refute them. For this reason we of the Anti-Fascist League against Holocaust Denial basically hold the position that the most effective and hard-hitting argument against Holocaust denial is <a href="http://de.metapedia.org/wiki/Volksverhetzung" target="_blank">Section 130</a> of our Criminal Code, which punishes said crime with up to five years imprisonment.

Unfortunately there are still anti-fascists foolish enough to try refuting the deniers on an objective level. Experience shows that this leads to no good results, as the deniers are hereby given an aura of respectability. Much more dangerous, however, is the fact that some Holocaust-denying neo-Nazis ably disguise themselves as anti-fascists in order to damage the true anti-fascists' reputation. The worst of these trojan donkeys is a certain <a href="https://k0nsl.org/blog/search/muehlenkamp/">Roberto Muehlenkamp</a>, who together with several of his companions from the brown swamp conducts the blog "Holocaust Controversies". On this blog they constantly produce arguments against Holocaust denial, which are so feeble-minded as to create confusion among fellow humans with insufficient historical knowledge and arouse the impression that the deniers may be right.

Together with four other neo-Nazis disguised as anti-fascists – Jonathan Harrison, Jason Myers, Sergey Romanov and Nicholas Terry – Roberto Muehlenkamp put a thick screed in PDF-Format on the Internet, which claims to refute the Holocaust deniers Carlo Mattogno, Jürgen Graf and Thomas Kues, who cynically deny the existence of gas chambers in the camps Belzec, Sobibor and Treblinka ("Belzec, Sobibor, Treblinka. Holocaust Denial and Operation Reinhard. A Critique of the Falsehoods of Mattogno, Graf and Kues"). It beggars description what idiocies are produced here especially by Muehlenkamp. Among other things he claims that 28 people can stand on one square meter! Hereby Muehlenkamp maliciously creates the impression that opponents of Holocaust denial are a bunch of hollow-heads.

Now Mattogno, Graf und Kues published a response (<a href="http://forum.codoh.com/viewtopic.php?f=2&t=8145" target="_blank">"The 'Extermination Camps' of Aktion Reinhard. An Analysis and Refutation of Factitious 'Evidence', Deception and Flawed Argumentation of the 'Controversial Bloggers'"</a>), in which the idiotic arguments of Muehlenkamp and his brown accomplices are taken apart on over 1500 pages and the five supposed "anti-fascists" are exposed to ridicule. That was the objective of this false flag operation from the beginning.

Who is Roberto Muehlenkamp? Thanks to years of research carried out under constant threat of life, in which she again and again infiltrated the neo-Nazi scene under false identity, our comrade Andrea Röpke brought to light the whole grisly truth about this man. Roberto Muehlenkamp is the son of the worst of all Nazi criminals, SS-Ober-Unterrottenführer Adolfo Muehlenkamp, who on 31 January 1933, the day after Hitler’s taking of power, with his own hands gassed three million Lichtenstein Jews in the giant swamps by Vaduz. (See Schmul-Habakuk Flunkerich, "Adolfo Muehlenkamp, the gas hangman of the Vaduz swamps", Manure Editors 2013). After the war Adolfo Muehlenkamp fled with the help of reactionary circles in the Vatican to South America and erected a training camp for right-wing radical terrorists in the Colombian jungle. In this camp his son Roberto was born. (Our comrade Andrea Röpke was there, disguised as a midwife.) 

On 1 September 2001, the 62nd anniversary of Adolf Hitler's march into Poland, Adolfo Muehlenkamp flew to Afghanistan and met Osama Bin Laden in a cave, to concoct the attacks on the twin towers. (Our comrade Andrea Röpke was there, disguised as a jihadist.) Ten days later, in the night of 10 to 11 September, Osama Bin Laden and Adolfo Muehlenkamp met in a New York striptease bar, in order to put the final touches on their terror plan over whiskey and gin. (Our comrade Andrea Röpke was there, disguised as a nude dancer.) After the towers collapsed Adolfo Muehlenkamp flew back to Colombia and built a training camp for Holocaust deniers in the jungle, which was attended by, among others, his son Roberto as well as his neo-fascist companions Jonathan Harrison, Jason Myers, Sergey Romanov and Nicholas Terry. (Our comrade Andrea Röpke was there, disguised as a Shoa-denier.) Thereafter Roberto Muehlenkamp, together with his neo-Nazi accomplices, founded the website "Holocaust Controversies" and issued the mentioned ridiculous pamphlet against Mattogno, Graf und Kues, in order to make a mock of all righteous anti-fascists. 

We appeal to all anti-fascists and opponents of Holocaust denial to under no circumstances visit the website "Holocaust Controversies" and to beware of the <a href="http://donkey.k0nsl.org:2001/" target="_blank">trojan donkey Roberto Muehlenkamp</a> and his brown accomplices!
