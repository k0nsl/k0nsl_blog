Firstly, National Socialism (1923-1945) is German and for Germans only. It’s true that neighbouring countries at the time, such as Denmark, Sweden and the Netherlands, had Nazi parties, but generally, it was for Germans at that particular historical time. The objectives were to break the Versailles Treaty, find living space for overpopulated Germany, deal with the military threat posed by France and the USSR, solve the German unemployment problem (not to mention the communist problem)...

Is there such a thing as Neo-Nazism? <a title="My Role in Berlin on July 20, 1944" href="http://vho.org/GB/Journals/JHR/8/1/Remer41-53.html" target="_blank">Otto Remer’s</a> Socialist Reich Party (1949-1952) in West Germany attempted it. It certainly looked and felt like Nazism. But even so, given that Germany’s position had radically changed since the days of the Versailles Treaty, the SRP’s program differed from the original.

Most people, when they use the word ‘Neo-Nazi’, are referring to the American/British variety. The movement was founded by George Lincoln Rockwell and Colin Jordan, two clowns who loved dressing themselves and their followers up in brownshirt uniforms. One couldn’t find anything more different from German National Socialism: the 'Neo-Nazis' insisted - and still do - that National Socialism was intended, not only for Germans, but for <i>‘all white people’</i>, including Russians, Czechs and Poles! These ‘white nationalist’ beliefs have been adopted by the skinhead movement.

Ernst Zündel wrote recently that he disparages those people who dress up in Nazi uniforms, as it’s an insult to the 15 million Germans who died for the National Socialist cause. I agree, it is insulting.

A typical argument against Revisionism goes like this: we can’t disprove the Holocaust because that would bring back Nazism; we can’t bring back Nazism because it would lead to another Holocaust. My reply to that is, if there was no Holocaust, then what’s wrong with Nazism?
