So:
<blockquote>What to call a Negro?</blockquote>

Until the mid 1960s, the worst insult one Negro could call another was "black". "Nigger" was not considered much of an insult at all, unless used by a white man, and not always even then. I have heard Negros call each other "Nigger" many, many times, sometimes repeatedly in a single sentence, often when they weren't even angry at each other! In the 1930s, the Negros decided that they wanted to be called "colored" (instead of black) then they decided that "colored" was "racist", so they decided they wanted to be called "Negro" (which simply means "black" in Spanish), then they decided that "Negro" was "racist", and they wanted to be called "black"! Now it's "African American". Calling an American Negro an "African" used to be a "racist insult" used almost exclusively in the Deep South by the Ku Klux Klan, but now they pretend it's what they want. Just so they can have an excuse to accuse us of "racism" by changing their minds about what they want to be called every five minutes, and demanding that we keep step.

Same thing with geography. The blacks in the Belgian Congo changed the name of the country from the "Congo" to "Zaire" even though "Congo" is African and "Zaire" is of Portuguese origin. One cannot keep up with this kaleidoscopic name-changing game, and it is a complete waste of time to try.
