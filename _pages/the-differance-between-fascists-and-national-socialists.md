Strictly speaking, the only "fascists" are the followers ofÂ <strong><a href="https://k0nsl.org/blog/detox/benito-mussolini-the-last-centurion/"><strong><em>Benito Mussolini</em></strong></a></strong>.

Loosely, the difference is that the National Socialists believed in the primacy of racial factors and deficit spending. The "Fascists" (and their various foreign imitators) placed little or no emphasis on race, were often hostile to racial doctrines generally and National Socialism in particular, and usually believed in a balanced budget. When Mussolini was appointed Head of State by the King of Italy in 1922, Italy had suffered 1.5 million people killed in the First World War; a politically-imposed bread subsidy threatened to destroy the Italian Lira as completely as reparations were destroying the German Mark, but could not be abolished because it was politically unacceptable; 180,000 politically-appointed railway employees could not be made to work but could not be dismissed; production was impossible because the Marxist-dominated labour unions had occupied all the factories and refused to work or leave; large parts of Italy were almost totally uninhabitable because of yellow fever or rocky, infertile soil and insufficient irrigation; irrigation and swamp-clearing projects had lain unfinished since the days of the ancient Romans. Mussolini balanced his very first budget, and solved all these problems in a very few short years, raising the birth rate of the Italian people and providing them with employment. These are significant accomplishments, which made "Fascism" very popular, at least initially.

<strong>It used to be considered self-evident that any nation requires its own industries and employment for its own people. It takes the genius of the Jews to "prove" that a nation can be dependent upon its enemies to manufacture everything it needs, while simultaneously flooding the country with unproductive foreigners.</strong>
