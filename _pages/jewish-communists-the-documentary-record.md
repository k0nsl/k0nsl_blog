<h2 align="CENTER">The Prop-Masters</h2>
<h3 align="CENTER">Perpetrators of the holocaust against Christian Russia transform themselves into "survivors" of a holocaust.</h3>
<p align="CENTER">The portraits at left are of the same man but in two different incarnations. On the far left we see Martin "Gray" in retirement after a successful career peddling fake antiques to gullible collectors. He is holding his mass market paperback, <cite>For Those I Loved, </cite>which is filled with his exploits as a saintly "Holocaust Survivor" who was supposedly forced to help clear bodies out of the Treblinka "gas chamber." The earlier portrait is of the youthful Gray as a highly-decorated officer in the Soviet NKVD (the savage forerunner of the KGB), responsible for the murder of millions of Christians in Russia and Eastern Europe. Even Establishment researchers have had to admit that Gray's book is as phony as the antiques he peddled. But Gray's scam is symbolic of countless other Communist ghouls who have managed to land on their feet in the West, disguised as poor, persecuted "Survivors of the Holocaust" and feted as the saints and martyrs of the universe. Meanwhile the holocaust <cite>they perpetrated</cite> against millions of Christians slips further down the dark environs of Orwell's memory hole.</p>

<strong>J</strong>ewish Professor Arno Mayer of Princeton in his important book, <em>Why Did the Heavens Not Darken? </em>states that the German invasion of Russia was carried out with the intention to eradicate Bolshevik (Soviet Communist) ideology. The Germans were hardly the only ones in the West to believe that, "Soviet Russia is a dictatorship of Jewry."

On Feb. 8, 1920 a young British writer made a similar observation in the <em>Illustrated Sunday Herald</em>:

"There is no need to exaggerate the part played in the creation of Bolshevism and in the actual bringing about of the Russian Revolution by these international and for the most part atheistical Jews."

The writer was Winston Churchill. Though he would later sell his soul for considerably more than thirty pieces of silver, his analysis of the authentic nature of Soviet communism remains trenchant.

Churchill expressed the crucial insight that the crimes perpetrated by Jewish communists against Germans and Russians instilled in those people a desire for retribution:

"In the Soviet institutions the predominance of Jews is even more astonishing. And the prominent, if not indeed, the principal, part in the system of terrorism applied by the Extraordinary Commissions for Combating Counter-Revolution has been taken by Jews, and in some notable cases by Jewesses.

"The same evil prominence was obtained by Jews in the brief period of terror during which <a href="http://detox.k0nsl.org/HungarianCommunistVermin1.html">Bela Kun</a> ruled in Hungary. The same phenomenon has been presented in Germany (especially in Bavaria), so far as this madness has been allowed to prey upon the temporary prostration of the German people.

"...The fact that in many cases Jewish interests and Jewish places of worship are excepted by the Bolsheviks from their universal hostility has tended more and more to associate the Jewish race in Russia with villainies which are now being perpetrated...Needless to say, the most intense passions of revenge have been excited in the breasts of the Russian people." (End quote from Churchill).

"...a letter sent to the Vatican by Pius XII in 1919, when he was Bishop Eugenio Pacelli and papal nuncio in Munich...reports on his deputy's unpleasant encounter with Bolshevik revolutionaries who were then terrorizing Catholic priests and the German bourgeoisie. The letter describes the leader, Max Lieven as a '... Russian and a Jew.' The letter also describes Mr. Lieven's companions, '...Jews like the rest of them.'...Bishop Pacelli's description of Jewish Communists...was hardly uncommon 80 years ago." (N.Y. Times, Nov. 3, 1999).

Chaim Bermant, writing in the <em>Jewish Chronicle </em>(Aug. 30, 1991), says: "It was Communism which toppled the hated Czars, Communism which removed Jewish disabilities and proscribed anti-Semitism and Communism which, in its early days at least, opened the doors to Jewish advancement."

Political analyst Joseph Sobran points out that the revelation of this "ethnic component" of Communism contests a cherished historical lie: "...the ethnic history of Communism is likely to complicate the conventional 'lachrymose version of Jewish history,' according to which Jews are always and everywhere innocent victims of Gentile prejudice and persecution."

Lenin, whose maternal grandfather, Israel Blank, was Jewish, said that Jews made the best revolutionaries: "The clever Russian is almost always a Jew or has Jewish blood in him." (Dmitri Volkogonov, <em>Lenin: A New Biography, </em>p. 112). Lenin was both clever and a revolutionary. He was surely referring to himself.

Researcher Wayne McGuire of Harvard University writes: "Lenin was a Jew by the standards of Israel's Law of Return: he possessed a Jewish grandparent. It would seem that not only was Lenin a Jew, but that he was a Jewish racist and chauvinist, although he kept his ideas on this volatile subject far in the background, probably because they were in radical conflict with the supposed universalism of Marxism. ...Lenin was a Jewish racist who deliberately gave Jews especially, the most 'intellectually demanding tasks.' He admitted that 50% of the communist terrorist vanguard in the south and west of Russia was comprised of Jews."

Lenin declared, "We are exterminating the bourgeoisie as a class." His partner in crime, Apfelbaum (Zinoviev) stated: "The interests of the revolution require the physical annihilation of the bourgeoisie class." Who were these bourgeoisie? Certainly not Jews. Trotsky gave a clue to their identity in a 1937 interview in the New York Jewish newspaper, <em>Daily Forward: </em>"The longer the rotten bourgeoisie society lives, the more and more barbaric will anti-Semitism become everywhere."

Bourgeoisie was a Bolshevik code-word for Gentile. The first law passed after the Communists seized power in Russia made anti-semitism a crime punishable by death. (<em>Izvestia,</em> July 27, 1918).

The top Communist Jewish official Zinoviev stated: "Without mercy, without sparing, we will kill our enemies in scores of hundreds. Let them be thousands; let them drown themselves in their own blood. For the blood of Lenin and Uritzky, Zinoviev and Vólodarsky, let there be floods of the blood of the bourgeoisie--more blood! As much as possible!" (<em>Krasnaya Gazeta,</em> Sept. 1, 1918).

The Jewish Bolsheviks regarded politics as a branch of Gentile pest control. Hatred of Christians, especially the peasant "bourgeoisie" was their prime motivation. The systematic destruction of the Christian peasantry of Russia as so many vermin, beginning with Lenin's attack on them in the summer of 1918 and his forced starvation in 1921, has been almost completely ignored in Western history.

According to the London, England "Jewish Chronicle" (Literary Supplement, Sept. 3, 1999, pp. iv and v) Jewish Communist writer Isaac Babel was present at a Soviet Communist gathering, "A meeting of...Jews...is being addressed by Commissar Vinogradov who is enthusiastically telling the...Jews: 'You are in power. Everything is yours." Babel also wrote of the "unbounded" Jewish "contempt for the Polish gentry."

According to the "Jewish Chronicle," Babel wrote for the Communist publication "Red Trooper" and a Soviet commissar related to him how they intended to deal with Cossacks: "The revolutionary curve has thrown into the first rank the free Cossacks soaked in many prejudices, but the Central Committee's maneuvering will rub them down with a brush of iron.' Babel expresses no opinion on the chances of successfully rubbing out the Cossacks' 'soaked-in prejudices,' a euphemistic term for vicious anti-Semitism..." ("Jewish Chronicle," Ibid.)

"In the last years of the '20s and the early '30s, Babel was regarded as one of the most notable talents in Soviet literature. Speaking at the first writers' congress in 1934...he made the expected avowals of loyalty and devotion to the revolution, the government and the state. He even praised Stalin's literary style." ("Jewish Chronicle," Ibid.)

In his story, "The Rabbi's Son," Babel places the portraits of Lenin and Rabbi Moses Maimonides side by side. He notes that the margins of Communist leaflets are crowded with "Hebrew verse."

The Siberian novelist Valentin Rasputin wrote in 1990: "I think today the Jews here in Russia should feel responsible for the sin of having carried out the revolution and for the shape it took. They should feel responsible for the terror--for the terror that existed during the revolution and especially after the revolution...their guilt is great. They perpetrated the relentless campaign against the peasant class whose land was brutally expropriated by the state and who themselves were ruthlessly murdered."

Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn's biographer recounts what it was like to grow up as a Russian Christian child among the children of the Jewish communist elite: "By the age of ten he had the cross ripped from his neck by jeering Pioneers and for over a year was held up to ridicule... Solzhenitsyn was, as a boy, exposed to students whose parents had an officially superior status. Most of the members of the Young Pioneers and Komsomol movements, at least in Rostov, were Jewish children..." (Michael Scammell,<em> Solzhenitsyn: A Biography, </em>p. 64).

According to the internationally-syndicated RNS wire service (reprinted in "The Christian News," Jan. 8, 1996, p. 2), "Some 200,000 (Christian) clergy, many crucified, scalped and otherwise tortured, were killed during the approximately 60 years of communist rule in the former Soviet Union, a Russian commission reported Monday (Nov. 27, 1995)...40,000 churches (were) destroyed in the period from 1922 to 1980..."

Here is the most genocidal political movement in world history, which created the largest concentration camps and the most horrendous slave labor system of the 20th century, in which millions of Christians were slaughtered (on the size of the Gulag concentration camp system cf. C. Andrew and O. Gordievsky, <cite>KGB: The Inside Story</cite> and N.Y. Times, Oct. 22, 1990, p. 82. None of these camps are being preserved for posterity. Most were destroyed long ago by special military brigades; cf. Michael Specter, "Cold Reminder," N.Y. Times, Dec. 3, 1994).

This was a movement staffed in its upper echelons by Jewish Communists and yet the world is comparatively silent about the holocaust and war crimes this thoroughly kosher system inflicted and the identity of the persons who were its architects.

Auschwitz is on the tip of every tongue but who has heard of Kolyma, Magadan, the Solovetsky islands and the other infernal Soviet centers of human destruction in eastern Siberia? Who has seen films and books about the millions of human beings worked, frozen and starved to death in the construction of the White Sea-Baltic Canal, over which stood a triumphant, colossal statue of the Jewish communist mass murderer Genrikh Yagoda?

The Jewish-communist epoch of mass murder has disappeared into history in one of the great vanishing acts of all time. Only practiced deceivers, with all the sleight of hand of the most accomplished stage magicians, could pull off such a coup against the rest of humanity. To trick mankind into focusing nearly all expiatory sentiment, monuments and commemoration on Jewish victims and brand the Mark of Cain--the very words war crime and holocaust itself--on Germany and upon Germans alone as their proprietary trademark, must be regarded as one of the most masterful achievements of psychological warfare in the annals of illusion.

Jewish power in the West today has expanded commensurate with the expansion of "Holocaust" propaganda, as noted by the Israeli author Moshe Leshem: "Israelis and American Jews fully agree that the memory of the Holocaust is an indispensable weapon--one that must be used relentlessly against their common enemy...Jewish organizations and individuals thus labor continuously to remind the world of it. In America, the perpetuation of the Holocaust memory is now a $100-million-a-year enterprise, part of which is government-funded." ( <em>Balaam's Curse, </em>p. 228)

This is why Edgar Bronfman, the billionaire Canadian Seagram's whiskey merchant and chairman of the powerful World Jewish Congress says, "The growing numbers of revisionist supporters cannot be ignored. We must use every resource to stop revisionism now, before it's too late."

The reason it must be stopped is because revisionism is the only force preventing the holy people from finishing the job they started in Russia and Bavaria, only this time they are using intellectual means to achieve the same end.

Consider the fact that the people who bear the brunt of contemporary Jewish racist hatred and invective, the Germans, have among the lowest birthrates and the highest abortion rates of any nation in the world. Far more Germans die every year than are born.

The self-hating Germans are not the only targets of corrosive gas chamber guilt, however. Organized Christianity (more accurately called Churchianity) nowadays is little more than one huge turkey flock, truckling, toadying and crawling in search of Jewish sanctification and approbation. Their savior called the Jewish leadership of his time, "the children of hell" (Matthew 23:15) but those who presume to speak in His name today, call them the saints and sages of the cosmos.

Only in such a profoundly falsified world soaked in fraud could the international media sit by, uninterested, as the great-great grandson of the blood-drenched Jewish Red Army commander Leon Trotsky, David Axelrod, shot to death an elderly Palestinian couple in November of 1990, as part of an Israeli, "Kach" terror group raid.

But imagine--if you can--the hubbub if a grandson of a Nazi war criminal had shot a Turkish couple in Germany. The weeping, wailing and never-ending references to "Never Forget" and "lessons of history" would seep out of the collective TV sets of the earth like waste from a toxic septic tank, because what is clear from such a double standard is that the true lessons of history are not being learned and recollection itself is hostage to the diorama of Zionist monomania.

Sixteen million ethnic Germans were forcibly expelled from Silesia, Moravia and the Volga regions of the eastern territories at the end of the Second World War. On this trail of tears, two million perished--shot to death, starved, raped and beaten. Ask one in one thousand, one in ten thousand people on the street today-- "Have you heard?" The answer will be no.

The Steven Spielberg movie images of cattle cars jammed with human cargo are reserved for Jewish victims alone. The 800,000 mostly Muslim Chechens deported by Jewish commissars and savagely stuffed into railway cars to Kazakhstan, where a quarter of a million died enroute, do not meet Hollywood's standard of cinematic focus.

The Soviet cattle car deportations afflicted more than a half-million Estonian, Latvian and Lithuanian Christians who were shipped to the Gulag. 12% of the entire Baltic population was either deported to Siberia or executed by the Jewish Soviet Secret Police. Who knows of it? Who cares? Who tries to keep this history from repeating? Instead, in 1995 the president of Lithuania made a pilgrimage to the Israeli gas chamber shrine at Yad Vashem to grovel and beg "forgiveness" for his people who were the <em>victims</em> of the Jewish Communist murderers. To seek forgiveness in all humility is ordained when it is predicated on the truth. To do so based on false witness in order to idolize the Pharisees is a mockery of justice.

In the Bolshevik era, 52 percent of the membership of the Soviet communist party was Jewish, though Jews comprised only 1.8 percent of the total population (Stuart Kahan, <em>The Wolf of the Kremlin,</em> p. 81)

The following is a list of some top Jewish Communist murderers, commissars, spies, assassins and propagandists (aliases are listed in parentheses). This list is by no means comprehensive. To catalog all of the Jewish communists involved in crimes would require hundreds of pages.
<h2 align="CENTER">Jewish Communists</h2>
<strong>V.I. Lenin,</strong> supreme dictator. <strong>Leon Bronstein (Trotsky)</strong>: supreme commander of the Soviet Red Army. <strong>Grigory Apfelbaum (Zinoviev)</strong>: executive, Soviet Secret Police. <strong>Solomon Lozovsky</strong>: deputy Soviet foreign minister. <strong>Maxim Wallach (Litvinov)</strong>: Soviet foreign minister. <strong>Yuri Andropov:</strong> director, Soviet KGB, later supreme dictator of the Soviet Union.

<strong>Jacob Sverdlov</strong>: first president of the Soviet Union. Sverdlov ordered the massacre of the Czar's family--women and children--in the town named after Catherine the Great, Yekaterinburg, (renamed Sverdlovsk in 1924 in honor of the murderer).

<strong>Jacob Yurovsky</strong>: commander, Soviet Secret Police. Yurovsky led the death squad which carried out Sverdlov's order for the murder of the Czar's family, including the bayoneting to death of the Czar's daughters. The Ipatyev house, where, in the basement, the massacre had occurred, stood intact until 1977, when the local Communist party boss at that time, Boris Yeltsin, ordered it demolished, lest it become a shrine to anti-Jewish sentiment.

<strong>Lazar Moiseyevich Kaganovich (pictured at left):</strong> chief mass murderer for Stalin, ordered the deaths of millions and the wholesale destruction of Christian monuments and churches, including the great Cathedral of Christ the Savior. Standing amid the rubble of the cathedral, Kaganovich proclaimed, "Mother Russia is cast down. We have ripped away her skirts." (N.Y. Times, Sept. 26, 1995).

<strong>Mikhail Kaganovich</strong>: deputy commissar of heavy industry, supervisor of slave labor, brother of Lazar. <strong>Rosa Kaganovich:</strong> Stalin's mistress; sister of Lazar. <strong>Paulina Zhemchuzina</strong>: member of the Central Committee and wife of Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov. <strong>Olga Bronstein</strong>: officer, Soviet Cheka Secret Police, sister of Trotsky, wife of Kamenev.

<strong>Genrikh Yagoda</strong>: chief of Soviet Secret Police, mass murderer extraordinaire. (Jewish poet Romain Rolland, winner of the Nobel Prize, wrote a hymn of praise to Yagoda).

<strong>Matvei Berman</strong> and <strong>Naftaly Frenkel</strong>: founders, the Gulag death camp system.

<strong>Lev Inzhir,</strong> commissar for Soviet death camp transit and administration. <strong>Boris Berman</strong>: executive officer of the Soviet Secret Police and brother of Matvei. <strong>K.V. Pauker:</strong> chief of operations, Soviet NKVD Secret Police.

<strong>Firin, Rappoport, Kogan, Zhuk</strong>: commissars of death camps and slave labor, supervised the mass deaths of laborers during the construction of the White Sea--Baltic Canal.

<strong>M.I. Gay:</strong> commander, Soviet Secret Police. <strong>Slutsky</strong> and <strong>Shpiegelglas</strong>: commanders, Soviet Secret Police. <strong>Isaac Babel</strong>: officer, Soviet Secret Police.

<strong>Leiba Lazarevich Feldbin (Aleksandr Orlov)</strong>: commander, Soviet Red Army; officer, Soviet Secret Police. Feldbin was chief of Soviet Security in the Spanish Civil War. He supervised the massacre of Catholic priests and peasants in Spain.

<strong>Yona Yakir:</strong> general, Soviet Red Army, member of the Central Committee. <strong>Dimitri Shmidt</strong>: general, Soviet Red Army. <strong>Yakov ("Yankel") Kreiser:</strong> general, Soviet Red Army. <strong>Miron Vovsi:</strong> general, Soviet Red Army.

<strong>David Dragonsky:</strong> general, Soviet Red Army, Hero of the Soviet Union. <strong>Grigori Shtern: </strong>general, Soviet Red Army. <strong>Mikhail Chazkelevich:</strong> general, Soviet Red Army. <strong>Shimon Kirvoshein:</strong> general, Soviet Red Army. <strong>Arseni Raskin:</strong>deputy-commander, Soviet Red Army. <strong>Haim Fomin,</strong> commander of Brest-Litovsk, Soviet Red Army. At least one hundred Soviet generals were Jewish (cf. <em>Canadian Jewish News, </em>April 19, 1989).

Generals who were not themselves Jewish often had Jewish wives. Among these were Marshal Voroshilov, Marshal Bulganin, Marshal Peresypkin and General Pavel Sudoplatov (Sudoplatov assassinated hundreds of Christian leaders including Ukranian Catholic Archbishop Teodor Romzha). This Jewish wife "insurance policy" extended to Politburo members such as Andrei Andreyev and Leonoid Brezhnev.

<strong>Sergei Eisenstein:</strong> director of communist propaganda films which depicted Christian peasants (<em>kulaks</em>) as hideous, money-grabbing parasites. The <em>kulaks </em>were subsequently massacred. (Cf. for example Eisenstein's <em>Bezhin Meadow</em>).

KOMZET: commission for the settlement of Jewish Communists on land seized from murdered Christians in Ukraine; funded by Jewish-American financier <strong>Julius Rosenwald.</strong>

<strong>Ilya Ehrenburg,</strong> Minister of Soviet Propaganda and disseminator of anti-German hate material dating from the 1930s. Ehrenburg instigated the Soviet Red Army rape and murder of German civilians. Referring to German women, Ehrenburg gloated to the advancing Red Army troops, "that blonde hag is in for a bad time."

In a leaflet addressed to Soviet troops, Ehrenburg wrote: "...the Germans are not human beings...nothing gives us so much joy as German corpses." (Anatol Goldberg, <em>Ilya Ehrenburg, </em>p. 197). Goldberg concedes that Ehrenburg, "...had always disliked the Germans...now that there was a war on he turned his old prejudice into an asset." (Ibid., p. 193).

<img src="http://detox.k0nsl.org/graphs/HumanGarbage/khaldei.GIF" alt="" width="197" height="262" align="LEFT" />Another publication distributed to the Red Army, this time as the soldiers approached Danzig, was described by a historian: "Millions of leaflets were air-dropped on the troops with a message composed by the propagandist Ilya Ehrenburg and signed by Stalin: 'Soldiers of the Red Army! Kill the Germans! Kill all Germans! Kill! Kill! Kill!" (Christopher Duffy, <em>Red Storm on the Reich).</em>

The Soviet leadership<em> </em>acknowledged that Ehrenburg sought the extermination of the entire German people (cf. <em>Pravda, </em>April 14, 1945. [<em>Pravda</em> was also published in a Yiddish edition, <em>Einikeyt)</em>. Ehrenburg won the Order of Lenin and the Stalin Prize. He willed his papers to the Israeli Yad Vashem 'Holocaust' Museum.

<strong>Solomon Mikhoels:</strong> commissar of Soviet propaganda. Soviet film propagandists: <strong>Mark Donsky, Leonid Lukov, Yuli Reisman, Vasily Grossman,Yevgeny Gabrilovich, Boris Volchok<em> </em></strong>and <strong>Lillian Hellman</strong>(old movies written by her continue to be broadcast on American telelvision).

Soviet propagandist: <strong>Yevgeny Khaldei</strong> who staged the photo of the raising of the hammer and sickle flag over the Reichstag in Berlin, May 2, 1945. Afterward, a special plane was waiting to fly Khaldei, Stalin's top Tass photographer, to a Moscow lab, where his photo was further doctored (loot displayed on one of the Soviet soldier's wrists was removed in the negative and Khaldei added clouds and smoke to the scene for dramatic effect (see photo of Khaldei and his beloved flag at left). Khaldei continued to work as a premier Soviet propagandist until his retirement from <cite>Pravda </cite>in 1972. His Communist propaganda is proudly on display at the Jewish Museum of New York and the Jewish Museum of San Francisco. <cite>N.Y. Times </cite>writer Vicki Goldberg exulted in the raising of the blood-drenched Soviet flag, emblem of the slaughter of millions of peasants and Christians; describing it as, "...a national (and worldwide) symbol of triumph, justice and revenge." (Jan. 31, 1997, p. B-26).

Jewish Anti-Fascist Committee (JAC): new form of the Bolshevik YEVKOM, Stalin's recruiting conduit for funding money, supplies and political influence for Soviet Russia from world Jewry as well as the dissemination of gas chamber atrocity propaganda (cf. <em>The Black Book)</em>.

<strong>Nikolai Bukharin:</strong> Lenin's chief theorist. <strong>Samuel Agursky:</strong> commissar. <strong>Karl Radek:</strong> member, Central Committee. <strong>Mikhail Gruzenberg (Borodin)</strong> commissar. <strong>A.A. Yoffe: </strong>commissar. <strong>David Ryazanov:</strong> advisor to Lenin. <strong>Lev Grigorievich Levin</strong>: physician, poisoner of Stalin's enemies. <strong>Lev Rosenfeld (Kamenev):</strong> member of the Central Committee.

<strong>Ivan Maisky:</strong> Soviet Ambassador to Britain. <strong>Itzik Solomonovich Feffer: </strong>commissar, Soviet Secret Police. <strong>Abraham Sutskever:</strong> Soviet terrorist-partisan. <strong>Mark Osipovich Reizen: </strong>Soviet propagandist, winner of three Stalin Prizes.<strong>Lev Leopold Trepper:</strong> Soviet espionage officer.

<strong><a href="http://detox.k0nsl.org/HungarianCommunistVermin1.html">Bela Kun (Kohen)</a>:</strong> supreme dictator of Hungary in 1919. Kun was later Stalin's chief terrorist in the Crimea. Kun's eventual successor was <strong>Matyas Rakosi,</strong> Jewish Communist mass murderer of Christians in Hungary. According to the Jewish Telegraph Agency of May 14, 1997, Jews "...played key roles in ushering Communist rule into Hungary. In fact, during the brutal oppression of the early 1950s, the regime's top five leaders were Jews. "

<strong>Zakharovich Mekhlis:</strong> top executioner for Stalin. <strong>Henrykas Zimanas:</strong> leader of Lithuanian communist terrorists, butcher of Christians.

<strong>Moshe Pijade (sometimes spelled Piade)</strong>: commander, Yugoslav Communist People's Army. Tito's top butcher of hundreds of thousands of Croatian Christians. Pijade later served as president of the Yugoslav Communist Parliament. At least eighteen generals in the Yugoslav Communist People's Army were Jewish. The Yugoslavian communist party sent massive arms shipments to Jewish fighters in Palestine in the 1940s.

<img src="http://detox.k0nsl.org/graphs/HumanGarbage/berman.GIF" alt="" width="227" height="303" align="RIGHT" />In post-war Poland that nation was completely dominated by Jewish communists: the torturer <strong>Jacek Rozanski,</strong> head of the Secret Police; the Politboro commander <strong>Jacob Berman (pictured at right)</strong>

and commissars <strong>Minc, Specht (Olszewski) </strong>and <strong>Spychalski.</strong> These men murdered or deported to Kolyma and the other Arctic death camps, tens of thousands of Catholic Poles.

According to Jewish researcher John Sack, "In 1945 many Poles felt (and not without reason) that Jews ran the Office of State Security...the chief of the Office was <strong>Jacob Berman,</strong> a Jew, and all or almost all the department heads were Jews." Sack reports that 75% of the officers of the Communist Secret Police in Silesia were Jews. He noted that many Jews in the Communist terror apparatus in Poland changed their names to Polish ones like <strong>General Romkowski, Colonel Rozanski, Capt. Studencki</strong> and <strong>Lt. Jurkowski.</strong> (cf. John Sack, The New Republic, Feb. 14, 1994, p. 6. Sack in this article also refutes some shoddy research performed by Daniel Jonah Goldhagen, author of <em>Hitler's Willing Executioners</em>, who, in the double standard typical of <a href="http://detox.k0nsl.org/wash.html">the Jewish mentality,</a> refuses to accept the proven fact that Jews ran the Polish Communist secret police even as Goldhagen asserts the racist myth that the entire German nation was guilty of genocide. Sack does a good job of proving Goldhagen wrong about Poland).

In Poland, "...a disproportionate number of Communists were Jews. In 1930, at its peak, 35% of the members of the party were Jewish. In Communist youth organizations, Jewish membership was even higher, while Communists of Jewish origin occupied most of the seats on the central committee. Communism appealed to some Jews because it opposed anti-Semitism more vigorously than any other Polish party...Jewish Communists reached their apogee in the years immediately after World War Two, when the party leadership was totally in the hands of the prewar Communist leadership that abhorred anti-Semitism." (Sheldon Kirshner, The Canadian Jewish News, Nov. 5, 1992, p. 16).

Of course when one encounters the issue of Jews, Communists and Catholics in Poland in the Establishment media or universities today, the mass murder of the Polish Catholics at the hands of the Jewish Communists, is never raised. Instead, a minor attack on Jews by Polish peasants enraged at the role of Jews in Communist terror, which occurred in July, 1946 at Kielce and which has come to be called the "Kielce pogrom" will be the centerpiece of the "discussion. " The motivation for the attack is not usually mentioned. Rather, the Catholic peasantry are painted in terms of "fiendish bigots" whose "blind, irrational hate" for the "poor, persecuted Jews" resulted in "yet another martyrdom of God's Chosen."

But the Catholic Primate of Poland at the time, Cardinal Hlond, a brave prelate <a href="http://detox.k0nsl.org/pope1.html">in a stalwart tradition of Christian resistance to Jewish tyranny in Poland,</a> so different from the traitorous philo-Judaism of the current Pontiff, stated that the attack in Kielce occurred because of resentment 'due to the Jews who today occupy leading positions in Poland's (Communist) government and endeavor to introduce a governmental structure that the majority of Poles do not wish to have." (Ibid., Kirshner).

As Piotr S. Wandycz of Yale University observes, "The average Pole could not but notice in the Stalinist era that the two most powerful men in the country--<strong>Berman</strong> and <strong>Minc</strong>--were both Jewish as was the dreaded security official<strong>Rozanski</strong>." (N.Y. Review of Books, Aug. 18, 1983, p. 51).

With this record it is interesting to note that the Polish occupant of the papacy, John Paul II, consistently lent his prestige and his presence to canonizations and commemorations of politically correct victims of the Nazis. Nowhere did this Pope breath a word about the openly Jewish, Communist massacres of Polish Catholics, Spanish Catholics, Croatian Catholics, Lithuanian Catholics--he was too busy, intoning the <em>Shoah,</em> referring to the heirs of the Pharisees as "our Elder Brothers in the Faith" giving official recognition to an Israeli state which even many orthodox, Haredi rabbis regard as a blasphemous and abominable entity, and attacking the German people as "the image of the beast."

<img src="http://detox.k0nsl.org/graphs/HumanGarbage/morel.GIF" alt="" width="204" height="322" align="LEFT" />

<strong>Solomon Morel (pictured at left):</strong> commandant of a post-war Communist concentration camp for Germans in Poland. Stalin deliberately put Jews in charge of such camps. Morel tortured and murdered thousands of Germans, sometimes with his bare hands (cf. "The Wrath of Solomon," <em>Village Voice, </em>March 30, 1993 and John Sack, <em>An Eye for an Eye). </em>Morel is comfortably esconsed in Tel Aviv. German survivors of Morel's camp have demanded he be tried as a war criminal, but for the Establishment media and the phony, partisan, "human rights" groups, bringing Morel to justice is simply a non-issue. After all, he murdered helpless Germans, so what's the problem?

<strong>Julius Hammer, M.D.</strong>: New York abortionist and co-founder of the American communist party. <strong>Armand Hammer:</strong> fundraiser and financier for Lenin and Stalin, son of Julius. "The Communist Party was also the most Jewish party in America. At least nineteen percent of the Young Communist League were Jews and never less than forty percent of its leadership." (Source: "Pakn Treger: From Yiddish Roots to the Frontiers of Jewish Culture," Fall 1997, p. 18).

<strong>Lev Davidovich Landau:</strong> Stalinist physicist, co-father of the Soviet atomic bomb. <strong>Klaus Fuchs:</strong> helped steal atomic bomb secrets for Stalin. <strong>Ruth Werner: </strong>colonel, Red Army GRU intelligence, assisted Fuchs. <strong>Julius and Ethel Rosenberg:</strong> stole American atomic bomb secrets for Stalin. <strong>Morris Cohen (Peter Kroger)</strong>: assisted the Rosenbergs. <strong>Markus Wolf: </strong>chief of German Communist Stasi Secret Police.

<strong>Howard Fast: </strong>American communist propagandist for Stalin. <strong>David Dubinsky:</strong> Stalin's ally, head of the U.S. International Ladies Garment Workers Union. <strong>Nahum Goldmann: </strong>founder, World Jewish Congress, communist propagandist. <strong>Rabbi Moses Rosen:</strong> agent, Romanian communist party. <strong>Victor Rothschild:</strong> top British espionage agent for Stalin.

<strong>Mark Zborowski:</strong> "...considered by historians of Soviet terror operations to have been the most fearsome...(Soviet) spy of all time" (Stephen Schwartz, <cite>Forward, </cite>Jan. 26, 1996). Zborowski, a medical researcher, murdered a dissident with a poisoned orange at the Soviet-run hospital in Paris. Zborowski was implicated in several other assassinations in 1936 and 1937. In the 1940s worked for both the American Jewish Committee and the KGB. In the 1960s Zborowski worked as a medical researcher at Mount Zion Hospital in San Francisco. He trained numerous psychiatrists and medical specialists in the Bay Area. He died in 1990 (cf. "The Strange Case of Doctor Zborowski and Monsieur Etienne" by Philippe Videlier, in <cite>Le Monde Diplomatique, </cite>Dec. 1992).

From 1936-1939, when Stalin's "International Brigade" forces were dispatched to Spain to fight the Catholics, Jewish Communists comprised the largest faction of his troops, "More than 40,000 volunteers fought in the International Brigade...A huge number of the volunteers were Jews: between 7,000 and 10,000 of the Internationals as a whole, more than one-third of the Americans." Jewish Communist <strong>Milton Wolff</strong> was the last commander of the American contingent. <strong>Rabbi Hyman Katz</strong> joined in order to fight Spanish Christians. (cf. Jeffrey Sharlet, "Troublemakers," <em>Pakn Treger,</em> Fall, 1997, pp. 16, 18 and 24).

The Communists slaughtered 6,549 Spanish priests, 283 helpless nuns and 13 bishops. "In Ciudad Real in the center of Spain, the bishop and every single priest of the diocese were murdered; not one escaped." --Dr. Warren H. Carroll,<em>70 Years of the Communist Revolution, </em>pp. 184-185, 188-189. (Also cf. Justo Perez de Urbel, <em>Catholic Martyrs of the Spanish Civil War </em>[Kansas City, Missouri: The Angelus Press, 1993).

Stalin's propaganda agent in Spain was New Yorker <strong>Leon Rosenthal.</strong>

On Oct. 16, 1948, 50,000 Jewish communists turned out in Moscow's Red Square to welcome the first Israeli delegation to Moscow. Stalin supported Zionism's 1947 Palestine partition plan, gave crucial recognition to the newly-created state of Israel and voted for Israel's admission to the United Nations.

In 1951 communist and Marxist parties had twenty-three seats in the Israeli Knesset. The kibbutz system was the most powerful movement in the country and the most powerful kibbutz leaders were nearly all Marxists. The biggest Israeli holiday was May Day, celebrated with rallies, marches, red banners and red songs.

As recently as 1987 the Israelis were providing the KGB with American intelligence secrets (cf. UPI dispatch by Richard Sale, Dec. 13, 1987 and <em>The City Paper </em>[Washington, DC], Jan. 15, 1988). Jonathan Jay Pollard was part of one such spy ring. British traitor and Communist spy Kim Philby was assisted in obtaining safe haven in the Soviet Union by the Israeli Mossad (cf. <em>Sunday Telegraph </em>[England], April 16, 1989). This was most appropriate since Philby's KGB handler in Moscow was also Jewish.

Romania's communist regime received favorable trade deals from the U.S. for years due to Israeli pressure on Congress in its behalf (<em>N.Y. Times, </em>Jan. 18, 1992, p. 23). The notion that the Zionist Jewish movement was anti-communist is a fallacy. The truth is more complex. There was a left wing and a right wing within Zionism. The rightists, like the terrorists Jabotinsky and Stern, took a fascist approach. Leftist Zionists like <strong>David "I am a Bolshevik" Ben-Gurion</strong>admired the Soviet model of Jewish power and sought to incorporate it as the political economy of the Israeli state.

"National and racial chauvinism is a vestige of the misanthropic customs characteristic of the period of cannibalism. Anti-semitism, as an extreme form of racial chauvinism, is the most dangerous vestige of cannibalism...under USSR law active anti-Semites are liable to the death penalty." (Stalin, <em>Collected Works, </em>vol. 13, p. 30).

The African National Congress (ANC) in South Africa was guided by two Communist Jews, <strong>Albie Sachs,</strong> "one of its foremost intellectuals"( London Sunday Times, Aug. 29, 1993) and <strong>Yossel Mashel Slovo (Joe Slovo)</strong>.

Slovo was born in a shtetl in Lithuania and grew up speaking Yiddish and studying the Talmud. He joined the ANC's terrorist wing, the Umkhonto we Sizwe, in 1961 and eventually became its commander. He was named Secretary General of the South African Communist Party in 1986. ("Joe Slovo," Jewish Chronicle, Jan. 13, 1995).

Slovo had been the " planner of many of the ANC terrorist attacks, including the 1983 car bomb that killed 19 people and injured many others... Slovo, who had traveled to the Soviet Union many times, was awarded a Soviet medal on his 60th birthday...Slovo is a dedicated Communist, a Marxist Leninist without morality of any kind, for whom only victory counts, whatever the human cost, whatever the bloodshed...Slovo disputes little of his image as 'the Communist mastermind' behind the ANC's armed struggle. For him the fears of South Africa's whites are both a measure of the ANC's growing strength and a crucial factor in hastening what he believes will be its ultimate victory. 'Revolutionary violence has created the inspirational impact that we had intended, and it has won for the ANC its leading position,' Slovo said." ("Rebel Strategist Seeks to End Apartheid," L.A. Times, Aug. 16, 1987, p. 14). When Nelson Mandela's ANC took over South Africa, Slovo was named Minister of Housing.

<h3>Nelson Mandela and Joe Slovo give the clenched fist salute in front of the blood-drenched Hammer and Sickle flag of Jewish Bolshevism.</h3>
<h3>Slovo, a Yiddish-speaking Lithuanian 'Jew,' was Secretary General of the South African Communist Party and director of the military wing of the ANC, which perpetrated numerous terror bombings against white civilians.</h3>

When we look at these gruesome personalities, who are only the tip of the Jewish iceberg that was Soviet Communism and who were responsible for the deaths of upwards of thirty million people; when we realize how little is written or filmed about their crimes, we begin to realize that the exclusive focus on the crimes of the Germans, real and imagined, is a function of propaganda.

If the facts about the Jewish Communist holocaust against the peasants and Christians of Russia and Eastern Europe were given massive publicity, the supposed "special evil" of the Germans would stand exposed as a racist fraud.

German actions during World War Two must be viewed in a vacuum in order for the New World Order to advance its covert objective of Jewish supremacy.

When Nazi actions are placed within the context of Jewish Communism's abominable crimes against the Christian people of Russia and Eastern Europe, the public will begin to understand that Hitler and the Nazis were a reaction, however unbalanced and excessive, to the Jewish Communist genocide against millions of Christians and peasants in the East.

This is why the crucial facts about Jewish Communism must never be documented in Hollywood films, discussed in university courses or pictured in contemporary news magazines. This is why Malcolm Muggeridge's book, an eyewitness account of the Jewish Communist holocaust against Christians, <cite>Winter in Moscow, </cite>has been tightly suppressed.

In the Sunday Telegraph (London, England: Nov. 18, 1990) the question is asked, "Why then has it (<cite>Winter in Moscow</cite>) never been republished? The answer may lie in Muggeridge's handling of what was then called the 'Jewish question.'...<cite>Winter in Moscow</cite> is acutely concerned with Jews...It was of course the case that a very disproportionate number of the early Bolsheviks were Jews and thus of commissars and <cite>apparatchiki.</cite>.."

<a href="http://revisionisthistory.org/">The Campaign for Radical Truth in History's</a> documentation of these forbiden facts constitutes the chief motivation for the suppression attempts of such Stalinist censorship groups as the A.D.L. and Simon Wiesenthal Center. Both of these organizations would, if they could, have this writer jailed for publishing the documentation herein in Germany, France, or Austria. They regularly supply "intelligence files" to those governments on pro-Christian and pro-German writers. In 1995 the ADL sought to assist the prosecution of 69 year old American writer Hans Schmidt who was imprisoned in Germany for publishing a newsletter in Florida. These Jewish censors would like to have similar laws passed worldwide, resulting in the jailing of more writers and researchers who will not toe the party line or worship the Golden Calf.

To give the other side of history, the revisionist side--to give voice to the voiceless millions of dead victims of Jewish Communism--is regarded as "hateful" by the vain Zionists who demand for themselves the right to vomit forth a daily barrage of sewage upon the sacred memory of our grandparents and ancestors. To defend against the dishonoring of our heritage and our ancestors, is surely not hate; it is the right of self-defense against psychological warfare.
