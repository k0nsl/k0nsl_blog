You can be hosted on k0nsl.org for free, no strings attached. The only real 'crux' is that you will be limited to using a subdomain (for example: yourname.k0nsl.org), but arrangements for adding your own domain is possible as well. If this offer should be of interest to anybody please e-mail me at <a href="mailto:i.am@k0nsl.org">i.am@k0nsl.org</a>, with your details, and describe (with specifics) what sort of site or project you're planning to deploy on my server.
